## Requirements

FitnessChallenge is designed too have fairly minimal requirements to build and use with your projects, but there are somes. If you notice any problems on your platform, please notify [`Hethsron JedaÃ«l BOUEYA`](mailto:hetshron-jeadel.boueya@uha.fr) or [`Omar CHICHAOUI`](mailto:omar.chichaoui@uha.fr) or [`Pranamika SOLANKI`](mailto:pranamika.solanki@uha.fr). Patches and fixing them for welcome !

## Development
For developement, before running the application, you need to clone this project on your local repository, open it with Android Studio and Build Apps as follows :

1. Clone the `FitnessChallenge` repo locally :

    ```console
        $ https://github.com/Winssench/FitnessChallenge.git
    ```

2. Open this project with Eclipse IDE

3. Run the application server [`Payara`](https://www.payara.fish/) by opening a terminal and executing the following command to start it :

    ```console
        $ asadmin start-domain
    ```

   To verify that you are running the application server, open a browser and go to [`http://localhost:4848`](http://localhost:4848) to display the Payara server console.

   Notice : To stop your application server, open a terminal and execute the following command :

    ```console
        $ asadmin stop-domain
    ```

4. For Windows users, install MySQL Server from this [`link`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/8.0/en/windows-installation.html). For GNU/Linux users, execute this command :
    
    Debian Like Systems
    ```console
        $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y
    ```
    
    Red-Hat Systems
    ```console
        $ sudo yum install @mysql -y
    ```
   
    Arch-Linux Systems
    ```console
        $ sudo pacman -Syy mariadb
    ```
   
5. Add MySQL Connector for Java Application you've downloaded in Payara by using this command :

    ```console
        $ asadmin add-library mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar
    ```
   
    To verify, that the connector has been loaded correctly, execute this command :

    ```console
        $ asadmin list-libraries
    ```
   
6. Create a JDBC Connection Pool to MySQL Server by using this command :

    ```console
        $ asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool --ping --restype javax.sql.DataSource --datasourceclassname com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource --property user=root:password=xxx:DatabaseName=rvm_jsf:ServerName=127.0.0.1:port=3306:useSSL=false:allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true:zeroDateTimeBehavior=CONVERT_TO_NULL:useUnicode=true:serverTimezone=UTC:characterEncoding=UTF-8:useInformationSchema=true:nullCatalogMeansCurrent=true:nullNamePatternMatchesAll=false mysqlpool
    ```

   If everything goes without error then you can deploy the application from your IDE on your server, if not, recreate the JDBC POOL.

7. Launch this project locally on your [`Payara Server 5.2020.7`](https://www.payara.fish/downloads/payara-platform-community-edition/)

## Bug Fixed

Eclipse is an IDE that sometimes has bugs. Not having been spared by this, we encountered a bug that we solved by creating a new table by hand. As an example, if this happens, we recommend using the following command:

   ```console
        $ create table toto(ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, ROLE varchar(255) NOT NULL, OWNERROLE_LOGIN varchar(255) , PRIMARY KEY (ID));
